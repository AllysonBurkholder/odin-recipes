        <img src="bagel-gf7cdad681_1280.jpg" alt="bagel sandwich">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is assembling ingredients.  There's no cooking.  Option for chopping and slicing vegetables.  Option to toast or grill if desired.  </p>
        <p>It's time to make a hummus sandwich.  The star of this sandwich is hummus, but what ingredient will be assisting? I like carrots, grilled zuchinni, raw onion, radish, lettuce, cabbage, and/or falafel to go with my hummus sandwich.  </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bagel, Bread, or Bun of choice, whatever you have available.  
                <br>You could even use a leaf of lettuce to make a wrap if you wanted.  </li>
            <li><strong>Hummus!</strong> It comes in many flavors, choose one that sounds good to you.</li>
            <li>Choose a sidekick ingredient from here, maybe even choose 2-</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steak Cut Carrots</li>
                    <li>Grilled Zucchini <sub>usually leftover after a bbq!</sub></li>
                    <li>Onion Slab</li>
                    <li>Falafel</li>
                    <li>Radish Petals</li>
                    <li>Cabbage Slaw</li>
                    <li>Salad Sandwich</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bun Dressing: mustard, caramalized onion, vegan tatziki, no animals mayo, etc. </li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This is a <em>Hummus</em> Sanwich afterall, so were going to start with the star ingredient! Using some kitchen tool like a metal offset spatula, apply hummus to one half of your B (Bread, Bun, Bagel)</li>
            <li>The start of assembly is to put your Bun Dressing on your B of choice.  I'll be putting mustard on a bagel.</li>
            <li>Take your sidekick ingredients and assemble them onto the dressed bun.  I'll be layering slabs of carrots I sliced to go on mine.</li>
            <li>Reunite the hummus half with the carrot and mustard half to make a sandwich!</li>
        </ol>
